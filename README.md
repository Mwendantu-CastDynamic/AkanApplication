##Technologies Used
This Akan Naming Application has been developed using the following technologies and methodologies
1. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

2. HTML5 - A scripting language for designing the layout and text Properties of Web-pages
3. JavaScript - A web based Front-end Object Oriented Programming language used to add functionality responsiveness and interactivity to websites.
4. CSS- Cascading style sheets used to add style formating and design webpage layout.
5. Bootstrap - Special libraries of CSS templates which are used to achieve a predictable and good results when styling webpages.

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
This entails identifying the code behaviour which we wish to generate in our code which we want our final application to be able to perform. 
We identify what the program should do first, then determine how to make it do it.
##Known Bugs
Possible bugs relate to the use of the JavaScript and its related functions which did nit generate the expected output even after persistent debugging.

HTML 5 also resulted in errors due to the mixing of HTML4 elements such as divs and spans with HTML5 elements such as flexboxes
